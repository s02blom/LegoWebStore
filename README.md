# Lego Web Store

## Description
This project models the data necessary for runing a manutacturing/ distribution center for lego. The project is a part of the course work for DV 1663 VT24.

## python-sql-devcontainer
This repository contains a dev container with a MySQL server and python. It also installs the necessary VS Code extentions to confortably run and develop the repository along with the python libraries to run all the code. 

### Env-file
The `.env` file should be located inside [`.devcontainer`](./.devcontainer/). Here is an example of an appripriate `.env` file:
```
DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1
DATABASE_USER=some_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=my-password
DATABASE_DB=my-database
DATABASE_PORT=3306
```
Do note however that this is the default port for MySQL Workbench and you might wish to change the port if you plan using that at the same time. The devcontainer currently utilizes the host network to bridge the application container and the MySQL container so it is recommended to keep the DATABASE_HOST as specified above. Please note that the root super user for your MySQL container will have the same password as your user. 

## Figures
All figures are a UML diagrams written using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). You can eather download [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/download) or use their online editor [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com/).
