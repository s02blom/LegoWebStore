# Lego Web Store

## Description
This project models the data necessary for runing a manutacturing/ distribution center for lego. The project is a part of the course work for DV 1663 VT24.

## python-sql-devcontainer
This repository contains a dev container with a MySQL server and python. It also installs the necessary VS Code extentions to confortably run and develop the repository along with the python libraries to run all the code. 

### Env-file
The `.env` file should be located inside [`.devcontainer`](./.devcontainer/). Here is an example of an appripriate `.env` file:
```
DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1
DATABASE_USER=ROOT
DATABASE_PASSWORD=my-password
DATABASE_DB=my-database
DATABASE_PORT=3306
```
Do note however that this is the default port for MySQL Workbench and you might wish to change the port if you plan using that at the same time. 

## Figures
All figures are a UML diagrams written using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). 

## Run
To run the front end (as of now) use `flask --app ./python/Host.py run`
When developing use this for live preview `flask --app ./LegoWebStore/app/views.py --debug run`.
