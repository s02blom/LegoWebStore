# Description
We are intending to develop a possible database similar to what would be needed if you were a 
Lego manufacturing facility or storage location. Lego does not usually sell in piece by piece but 
in different building kits, intended to be assembled by the end user. This means that we, as the 
provider need to assemble all the different pieces of the many different kits before shipping them 
to the customer. That means that we need to have an exact count of every piece and know 
exactly what the different kits require.
